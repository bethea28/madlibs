Architecturally, I broke the app down into resuable components that serve a single purpose. I made the decision to handle all of the core logic and state management on the Redux side of things instead of mixing it within the component's state. I also added the ability for Redux to use thunks. CSS wise I utilized the BEM methodology http://getbem.com/.
Along the way I had to refresh my knowledge in Redux and React Prop types because they are not libraries that I typically use. Ultimately, there are better ways to solve the problem.
